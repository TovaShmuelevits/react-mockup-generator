# 🚀 AI Mockup Generator

Welcome to the React Mockup Generator project! This project aims to create a tool that generates "applications" using predefined React components such as headers, text, buttons, tables, and images. The project is divided into several development phases, each with specific goals and tasks.

## 📝 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a code generator for reusable JSX (React HTML) components. The generator will allow users to create mockup applications by assembling predefined components. The project also explores the integration of AI (ChatGPT) to generate code snippets based on natural language instructions.

## 📚 Project Phases

### ⚛️ 1. React Component Development

**Objective:**  
Use the existing sample application with TypeScript and TailwindCSS to develop reusable React components.

**Tasks:**

- 🧩 **Component Creation:**  
  Create the following stateless components with the prefix `RMG`:  
  - `RMGHeader`
  - `RMGText`
  - `RMGInput`
  - `RMGButton`
  - `RMGImage`
- 🏷️ **Props Definition:**  
  Define TypeScript interfaces for each component's props for clear and documented code.
- 🎨 **Basic Styling:**  
  Apply TailwindCSS classes to ensure consistent and modern design.
- 🧪 **Render Testing:**  
  Create a test page within the app to render each component and verify correct functionality.

**Example: `RMGButton` Component**

```tsx
// src/components/RMGButton.tsx
import React from 'react';

interface RMGButtonProps {
  title: string;
  onClick?: () => void;
}

const RMGButton: React.FC<RMGButtonProps> = ({ title, onClick }) => (
  <button
    onClick={onClick}
    className="bg-black text-white py-2 px-4 rounded hover:bg-opacity-90 focus:outline-none"
  >
    {title}
  </button>
);

export default RMGButton;
```

### 🤖 2. Model Generation with ChatGPT

**Objective:**  
Evaluate the ability to generate code snippets using ChatGPT by providing specific instructions.

**Tasks:**

- ✍️ **Instruction Definition:**  
  Create precise prompts that allow ChatGPT to generate the desired JSX code snippets.
- 🔬 **Experimentation:**  
  Use ChatGPT to generate code for predefined designs and assess its capabilities.

**Example Input and Output:**

- **Input:**  
  "Create a JSX code snippet for a user profile card including a profile image, full name, and a 'Follow' button."
- **Expected Output:**  

  ```tsx
  <div className="flex flex-col items-center p-4">
    <RMGImage src="path/to/profile_picture.png" alt="Profile Picture" />
    <RMGText className="font-bold text-lg mt-2">John Doe</RMGText>
    <RMGButton title="Follow" onClick={handleFollow} />
  </div>
  ```

**Deliverables:**

- A list of prompts and the JSX code snippets generated by ChatGPT.
- A report analyzing the accuracy and usability of the generated code.

### 🌐 3. Dynamic Code Generation Service

**Objective:**  
Establish a service that receives natural language descriptions and returns JSX code using an AI model.

**Tasks:**

- Set up a Node.js backend service.
- Create an API endpoint to process requests.
- Securely integrate with the OpenAI API.
- Adapt the response to return JSX code.
